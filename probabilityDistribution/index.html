    <p>
    Here, test score data following a normal distribution is simulated.
    The x-axis is the test score and the y-axis represents the frequency of
    that score. The program collects the data point by point and increases the
    height of each green dot when it encounters a test of that score.
    This means the height of a green dot is the frequency of that score.
    As time goes on, the frequency plot starts to look like the normal distribution.
